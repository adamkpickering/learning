      "answer": "The thing to be aware of here is abstraction layers. If wrapping an error violates an abstraction somehow then you shouldn't wrap it.   For example, if I were to write a filesystem implementation of the DeckSource interface, it would break the DeckSource abstraction if the implementation were to wrap errors that pertain to reading and writing files. This is because other implementations may not even have files.",
